A virtual mouse is a software-based input device that simulates the functions of a physical mouse. It allows users to interact with their
computers and devices without the need for a physical mouse. This can be particularly useful in various situations, such as when physical
mice are not available, when accessibility needs arise, or for specific applications like touchscreen interfaces and virtual reality environments.
